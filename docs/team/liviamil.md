### Project: uNivUSal

uNivUSal is a desktop application used to link CS2103T users to all the modes of communication of other users to make their lives easier. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort entries.
    * What it does: allows the user to sort all persons in uNivUSal
    * Commands: `sort`
    * Justification: This feature improves the navigability for users to traverse through their contacts. It can also be
  integrated with other fields to support future implementation.

* **New Feature**: Added a tutorial field for a person.
  * Justification: Supports the aim of the app to cater it to CS2103T students and TAs. This field would allow TAs to
  keep track of the students in their tutorial group.

* **New Feature**: Added a **add to favorite group** shortcut.
  * Commands: `fav`
  * Justification: **favorite** would be the basic group a user would need in their contact list.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=liviamil&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByAuthors&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=liviamil&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false&reverseAuthorshipOrder=false)

    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

    * Developer Guide:

    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

[![CI Status](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/actions)

**uNivUSal** is an ongoing desktop app project for managing contacts catered to CS2103T students, TAs, and professors;
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, uNivUSal can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. <br>
